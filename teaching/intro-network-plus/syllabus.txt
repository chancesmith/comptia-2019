- 5. Why Use Networks?
	- Network
		– Group of computers and devices
		- Connected by transmission media
	- Stand-alone computer
		– Not connected to other computers
		– Uses local software and data
	- Advantages of networks
		– Device sharing by multiple users
		- Saves money and time
		– Central network management
- 6. Types of Networks
	- Models vary according to:
		– Computer positioning
		– Control levels over shared resources
		– Communication and resource sharing schemes
	- Network models
		- Peer-to-peer
		- Client/server
- 7. Peer-to-Peer Networks
