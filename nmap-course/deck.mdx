---

# How do I start Nmap?

Open your terminal and type:
`$ nmap`

You should have the manual printed out. These are different options we have available.

---

# What is a con of Nmap?

---

# What is a pro for using Nmap?

A wonderful part of Nmap, is being able to scan anonymously or quitely so we aren't detected.

---

# How can I test Nmap's scanning ability?

Nmap.org has a server up and running for testing. This is a great way to test your skills.

# Get permission to scan

On any server you are scanning, be sure you have written permission to do so. #keepItLegal

# Let's break down a scan

`$ nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org`

# Let's break down a scan

`$ nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org`

- `-v` Print version number

---

# Let's break down a scan

`$ nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org`

- `-v` Verbose - Print version number
- `-A` Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute

# Let's break down a scan

`$ nmap [-options] [target]`

# Let's break down a scan

`$ nmap [-options] [target]`

The target could be a domain or range of IPs

---

# Need an IP?

Use `nslookup` to get an IP from a domain.

- `$ nslookup scanme.nmap.org`

---

1000 ports is not efficient. It is best to pick the ports you want to attack.

---

# Scan once. Saving results.

Nmap takes time to scan all the ports you wish to check. There is a lot of data and saving it would be better rather than running the scan again.

---

# Scan once. Saving results.

`$ nmap -oG - 192.168.1-0-255 -vv > ./results`

- `-oG` Output scan in Grepable format to the given filename.
- `-vv` double verbose

---

# Scan once. Saving results.

My local setup IP is `10.0.1.14`, so this is the command I ran...

`$ nmap -oG - 10.0.1.0-255 -vv > ./results`

---

# Scan once. Saving results.

The results you get should look like this:

```
# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Mon May 20 21:15:35 2019

# Scan once. Saving results.

No need to scan all the ports. Let's just scan port 22 on all IPs into a new file.

`$ nmap -oG - 10.0.1.0-255 -p 22 -vv > ./results2`

- `-p [port-number]` port numbers you wish you scan
